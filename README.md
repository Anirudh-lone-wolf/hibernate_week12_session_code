# hibernate_week12_session_code
* My code for hibernate mappings. The concole shows a large stack Trace of excpetions when I run the code. Please review it and Inform of any inconsistencies
* I am trying to achieve Many to many mapping between Student and Course. The join table is getting created but no values are being entered in 'Student' entity table the join table entity 'Student_courses' in the database(MYSQL) side. I have attached all the java files, sql file and xml file related to this project. I have also tried to attach the screenshot of the exception stacktrace.
* THE PROBLEM IS IN THE DRIVER CLASS : StudentClient.java
* All instructions where followed as per the faculty's instructions. If I have commneted out something in the code, it is beacause of that. 
* THANK YOU
